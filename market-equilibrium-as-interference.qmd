Standard causal inference methods assume that the potential outcomes of a unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of every other unit. The violation of this assumption is called interference. A classic example is vaccination, where the vaccination of others in the community reduces the spread of disease among all members of the community. The classical approach for handling interference is to partition units into groups such that all interference occurs within groups [@hudgens_toward_2008; @drew_dimmery_causal_2025]. The "General" portion of @fig-general-vs-market-interference shows an example where interference can be isolated by clustering units into groups. Another set of approaches isolate social spillovers by partitioning using a social network [@aronow_estimating_2017; @ugander_graph_2013]. Markets, however, bring interference that cannot be tackled with either of these sets of approaches. Market equilibrium is determined by all sources of supply and demand, causing the treatment of any unit to interfere with the outcomes of all units. The "Market Equilibrium" portion of @fig-general-vs-market-interference shows this interference structure. As each unit affects all other units, it is not possible to cluster units to isolate interference. On the other hand, knowing that the interference is channeled through the price effect provides sufficient structure for alternative approaches [@wager_experimenting_2020; @munro_treatment_2025].

![In the general interference setting, the treatment assignment of a unit affects the outcomes of some other units directly. In this figure, interference between units is clustered in groups of 3. In markets, the treatment assignment of all units interferes with the potential outcomes of all units through the price effect (represented as P). This figure was inspired by a sketch in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021's talk.](figures/general-vs-market-interference.png){#fig-general-vs-market-interference}

@wager_experimenting_2020 provides a method for finding the optimal price level $p^*$ from the perspective of the market platform by experimentation. The methodology models the market equilibrium as the proportion of suppliers that choose to participate at the price level $p$ ($\PropSupplierActive$). This approach builds on the sufficient statistics literature from economics, where intractable structural models are reduced to a small number of statistical relationships that represent elasticities [@chetty_sufficient_2008].

The optimal price level $p^*$ is the price at which the market platform's utility--the difference between overall revenue and payments to suppliers--is maximized.

The platform knows its own utility function ($R$ and $r$), the market allocation mechanism ($\Omega$ and $\omega$), and the payment scheme ($\pi$), but does not know the global state ($A$), demand ($D$), or supplier behavior ($f_{B_i}$) in advance.

## Market Equilibrium Through Supply and Demand

1. The platform chooses the payment policy $\pi$ and draws the supplier-level payments $P_i \sim \pi$.
2. Each supplier learns the payment policy $\pi$ and their payment $P_i$ and decides whether to be active.
3. The platform allocates demand to active suppliers.

The methodology simplifies market equilibrium to three "key statistics":

- $\mu(p)$: proportion of suppliers that are active at the price level $p$
- $q(\mu)$: expected demand allocated per active supplier
- $\triangle(p)$: marginal response of suppliers to changes in $p$ holding the rest of the market fixed

"Global Interference"

## Directions for Future Research

Off-policy estimation (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Counterfactual models of the market using neighborhood or even global estimation of the "key statistics" (~54:30 by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Applying this approach to global interference to other economics research desgins (~45:00 in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Being able to experiment when we don't control the market (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje starting at ~55:00 in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021). Very different when the experiment is a subset of the whole market.

Possible to do "interference mostly through price" (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021 starting around ~56:00)
