Standard causal inference methods assume that the potential outcomes of a unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of every other unit. The violation of this assumption is called interference. A classic example is vaccination, where the vaccination of others in the community reduces the spread of disease among all members of the community. The classical approach for handling interference is to partition units into groups such that all interference occurs within groups [@hudgens_toward_2008; @drew_dimmery_causal_2025]. The "General" portion of @fig-general-vs-market-interference shows an example where interference can be isolated by clustering units into groups. Another set of approaches isolate social spillovers by partitioning using a social network [@aronow_estimating_2017; @ugander_graph_2013]. Markets, however, bring interference that cannot be tackled with either of these sets of approaches. In markets, the equilibrium is determined by all sources of supply and demand, causing the treatment of any unit to interfere with the outcomes of all units. The "Market Equilibrium" portion of @fig-general-vs-market-interference shows this interference structure. As each unit affects all other units, it is not possible to cluster units to isolate interference. On the other hand, knowing that the interference is channeled through the price effect provides sufficient structure for alternative approaches [@wager_experimenting_2020; @munro_treatment_2025].

![In the general interference setting, the treatment assignment of a unit affects the outcomes of some other units directly. In this figure, interference between units is clustered in groups of 3. In markets, the treatment assignment of all units interferes with the potential outcomes of all units through the price effect (represented as P). This figure was inspired by a sketch in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021's talk.](figures/general-vs-market-interference.png){#fig-general-vs-market-interference}

@wager_experimenting_2020 provides a method for experimenting in marketplaces. Markets operate under equilibrium, meaning that all units interfere with one another.

"Global Interference"

## Directions for Future Research

Off-policy estimation (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Counterfactual models of the market using neighborhood or even global estimation of the "key statistics" (~54:30 by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Applying this approach to global interference to other economics research desgins (~45:00 in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021)

Being able to experiment when we don't control the market (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje starting at ~55:00 in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021). Very different when the experiment is a subset of the whole market.

Possible to do "interference mostly through price" (as mentioned by Fredrik Sävje in @stefan_wager_stefan_2021 starting around ~56:00)
